# Barnstormer

## Running locally

This project now uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for local development and production builds.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server will start and print a local URL that you can open in your browser to play the game. To create a production build, run `npm run build`.
